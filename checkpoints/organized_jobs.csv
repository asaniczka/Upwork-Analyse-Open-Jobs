"Chrome Extension To Scrape Facebook Group Members","Hourly: $15-$35 - Expert - Est. Time: Less Than 1 Month, Less Than 30 Hrs/Week We Have An Existing Chrome Extension That Imports Facebook Group Members. It Does This By Looking At The Html On The Group Members Page And Extract The Information From There. Our Current Method Of Extracting Members Has A Limitation That As The List Of Members Grows It Takes Longer For More Members To Get Scrolled Onto The Page. At 3000 Members It Takes 5 Second To Scroll Another 10 On The Pagebut When You Get To 6000 Members It Takes 10 Seconds To Scroll Another 10 On The Page, And It Gets Slower From There So A Group With 50K Members Would Take Days To Import. We Have Competitors That Extract The Group Members By Making An Http Request To Http://Www.Facebook.Com/Api/Graphql/... Instead Of Scraping The Data From The Page. This Seems To Work Well Even When There Are A Large Number Of Group Members. Note: This Is Not A Documented Api And I Suspect It Is For Facebook Internal Use Only!! For This Job You Will Write A Replacement For Our Member Import Code That Instead Gets The Group Members Using The Undocumented Facebook Api. You Will Either Have Experience Using This Api Or You Will Be Prepared To Research Our Competitor Code And Figure Out How To Use The Api. We Will Likely Have Other Improvements For You To Make If This Job Is Successful."

"Amazon Scraping Amazon Keywords Tracker","Fixed-Price - Intermediate - Est. Budget: $1,500 Hello Everyone, Before Submitting Your Offer, Please Ensure Two Important Criteria Are Met. I Apologize For Any Inconvenience, But These Are Crucial For Effective Collaboration: 1. Your Native Language Must Be Arabic. 2. I Am Specifically Seeking Programmers From The Following Countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia. This Is To Ensure Mutual Understanding Due To The Close Proximity Of Dialects. Thank You For Your Attention To These Requirements. Please, Don'T Submit Your Proposal Without Thoroughly Reading And Understanding The Project. Any Generic, Copy-Paste Proposal Will Not Be Considered, As This Project Is Substantial And Requires Serious Commitment. There Are Specific Details That Need To Be Addressed In Your Proposal, Which I Will Outline For You. I Intend To Build A Website Containing Tools To Assist Amazon Sellers, And The Site Will Feature Many Such Tools. However, I Cannot Develop The Entire Website All At Once. Firstly, I Need To Test The Programmer And Their Expertise. Secondly, I Cannot Finance The Entire Project In One Go, As It Will Cost Thousands Of Dollars. Therefore, For Now, I Want To Build Just One Tool Known Among Amazon Sellers As An ""Amazon Keyword Tracker."" The Task Of The Tool, In Short, Is To Determine The Position Of A Specific Product On Certain Keywords. We Provide The Tool With The Product Link And The Keywords We Want To Track. The Tool Then Searches Amazon Using These Keywords And Returns The Product'S Position To Us. For Example, If The Product Is Found On The 15Th Position On The First Page, The Tool Records The Position And The Tracking Date. After A Set Period, Typically 24 Hours, The Tool Searches For The Product Again Using The Same Keywords And Records The Results. A Line Chart Is Then Generated To Track The Product'S Position On Those Keywords. The Tool Is Straightforward, With No Complexities. The Only Challenge Lies In Crawling Amazon Because They Have Robots And Challenging Captchas To Bypass. So, A Proper Method Needs To Be Devised For Crawling Amazon Without Issues. In Your Proposal, I Need The Following: 1. Confirm That You Understand The Project And Its Requirements. 2. Clarification Of The Operational Requirements For The Project. I'M Unsure About The Crawling Mechanism On Amazon. Will It Be Direct From Our Tool To Amazon Or Through Aws Or Other Services? 3. I Need To Know The Monthly Operational Cost For Every 100,000 Crawling Operations Per Day, Including Hosting Expenses Capable Of Handling Such Tasks And Any Other Expenses Like Aws Or Others. Regarding The Website, It Will Be Public And Will Include Memberships With Features Such As: - Creating Member Accounts And Profiles - Payment Gateways - Monthly/Yearly Subscription Packages - Admin Dashboard For The Tool, There Will Be Two Systems For Inputting Products: 1. Manual, Through An ""Add"" Button Where The User Inputs The Product Link And Desired Keywords. 2. Through An Excel File Upload Containing Product Links And Keywords To Be Tracked For Each Product. Concerning Tracking, Each Keyword Should Have Multiple Time-Tracking Options, Typically Every 24 Hours, But I Want To Add Other Options Like 1 Hour, 6 Hours, And 12 Hours. This Is Because Some Keywords Are More Critical, Requiring Intensive Tracking. During The Product Search On Specific Keywords, I May Request It To Be Done As An Advertisement, As We Also Run Ads On Amazon. The Product May Appear Organically Or As Sponsored. Additionally, We May Request Tracking For Our Competitors On Those Keywords, So We Might Specify 1-3 Competitors To Track Their Positions As Well. Important: The Charts Generated Should Be Visually Appealing, Fast, And Without Any Lag. I Want A Demo System On The Website Instead Of A Free Trial To Avoid Spam Emails And Repetitive Registrations. Users Can Access A Demo Account Where They Can See The Tool With Added Products And Keywords That We'Ve Included In The Admin Panel. If They Like The Tool, They Can Then Proceed To Payment And Subscription. Apologies For The Length, But Despite The Project'S Simplicity, There Are Critical Details. If Any Of These Are Overlooked, The Tool Won'T Function Properly. So, Please Refrain From Submitting A Proposal If You'Re Not Capable Of Handling This Type Of Project. This Isn'T A Wordpress Site Or An E-Commerce Store; It Requires Genuine Programming. If You Succeed In The Initial Task, We'Ll Proceed With Other Tools In Separate Projects On Upwork With Appropriate Budgets. Thank You For Taking The Time To Read This, And I Wish You The Best Of Luck."
